This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints. If a `design.json` file exists, use it as the source of truth for design tokens.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

**Avoid overusing:** Roboto, Arial, default system fonts

**Impact choices by context:**
- Editorial: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Fraunces, Newsreader
- Code/Technical: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, IBM Plex Mono
- Startup/Modern: Clash Display, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk
- Distinctive: Bricolage Grotesque, Obviously, General Sans

**Pairing principle:** High contrast = interesting. Display + monospace, serif + geometric sans, variable font across weights.

**Consider contrast:** Vary weights noticeably (e.g., 300 vs 700) and use meaningful size differences between headings and body text.

### Color & Theme

Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.

If `design.json` exists, map its color tokens to CSS variables and use them consistently throughout.

### Motion

Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available.

Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

### Spatial Composition

Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, and grain overlays.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER use)

- Overused font families (Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Converging on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.

## Implementation

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

If `design.json` exists, apply its tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back - show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
